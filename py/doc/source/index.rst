WaveConnect Python Module Documentation
=======================================

Overview
--------

This is the documentation of Python modules developed to gather input to support
the simulation and modelling of wave regimes.

.. note::

  This code has been developed using Python 2.7.  It may not work correctly with
  other versions of python.  Python 2.7 may be obtained from `python.org
  <http://www.python.org>`_.
  
  In addition, in order to produce usable Matlab output, NumPy 1.5 or greater
  and SciPy 0.8 or greater must be installed.  The current official Windows
  installer for SciPy has been found to be defective.  Working installers for
  Windows can be found at `http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
  <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_
